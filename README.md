ðŸ“Œ Development Notes

This project was built under tight deadlines, so some parts mix English and Spanish for simplicity and speed.

The main pipeline works end-to-end:

Scraping from Cal eProcure and SAM.gov (simulated)

Normalizing and enriching the data in JSON format

Automatic Slack alerts

Full orchestration via Docker Compose

Optional tasks pending:

Test coverage â‰¥ 70%

Exported low-code workflows (01_ingest.json â€¦ 05_notify.json)

Visual front-end (Airtable / Webflow interface)
